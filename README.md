# Zomato Performance Analysis and Dashboard || Power-BI


Zomato Top 15 Countries Data Collection and Dashboard.
Under this project, I collected some information related to Zomato.In this project, we have countries along with their codes and cities where Zomato is performing, the Cuisine offered in restaurants, the Average cost for two people, the Number of table bookings in online delivery and offline delivery, Average rating as per different cities and their restaurants, and the Total votes.
## Top Findings in this Project:
1. We used the country code and name to calculate the total number of countries performing. This is shown in the dashboard by the total of 15 countries by using a card visual in Power BI.
2. We use cuisines offered in different restaurants from different countries to find out a total number of cuisines, that is 1826 overall, and shown in a dashboard by using a card visual.
3. We used the count of restaurants and an average of aggregate ratings to find out the top 5 countries and their ratings. This is shown by using a line and stacked column chart. We also use DAX calculations of count and average.
4. We had calculated the average rating by all 15 countries, which was shown in the dashboard by using a line chart in this, we had use DAX function for calculating average rating by every country. This is shown with the help of a line chart, which shows a downward slope as per country rating from highest to lowest.
5. We had calculated the total number of bookings and their overall percentage in offline and online mode. This was shown in the dashboard by using doughnut charts.
6. We use a matrix visual to show countries and the sum of total restaurants running into each country.
7. Lastly, in a dashboard, we use a table visual to show the total City count by each country.
This is all about my project, which is related to Zomato's performance in the top 15 countries.
